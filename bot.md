**Welcome to chat with PopBots!**

PopBots are a family of quick three to 5 minutes conversation bots that represent different “personalities” that a bot could take while supporting stress management. They share the same intro and closing, but they all treat stress differently. Our philosophy is that chatbots should look and act different than humans. Multiple-styles could be a characteristics of modern therapeutic chatbots.

# The family:

- **doom bot** - helps in seeing that while times may get tough, everyone is 

- **sherlock bot**- helps you to brainstorm a solution

- **glass-half-full bot** - helps to brainstorm some positives about the situation

- **Sir Laughs-a-bot** - helps to add a bit of humor to the problems you may face

- **chill bot** - helps to do a visualization or breathing exercise

- **treat yourself bot** - Is the sassy friend that helps you to know that you can offer yourself a hand

- **dunno bot** - is a bot that helps you to brainstorm things that you are excited about in your life

The family of bots are named: ‘**worst case’, ‘problem solving’, ‘positive thinking’, ‘humor’, ‘relaxation’, ‘self love’, ‘distraction’.** I like to think of them as a family of 7 dwarfs.

# How to start!?

To start talking with a bot, say hello and a bot will introduce themselves. They are friendly and trying their best, even if sometimes they can get a little bit confused.

# Tips and tricks

1. To change bots, type out the bot name as seen above under “family” , such as type 'positive thinking' and type 'hello' again to start conversation with glass-half-full bot.

3. If you want a random bot, simply write 'changebot' and you will be given a random bot.

5. If you want to restart a conversation, type 'restart'.

7. If you have any questions or concerns, please email stressbotcommuter@gmail.com.

9. If at any point you feel unsafe while chatting, please call 911. We understand that sometimes stress can be a lot, and chatbots are not meant to replace humans, but rather support people in different ways.
